# 100 Days of Code – Python 📘

Welcome to my **personal learning journey** through Python, inspired by CodeWithHarry’s 100 Days of Code series. This repo isn't about a polished product—it’s about documenting growth, challenges, and progress from total beginner to confident intermediate developer.

## 🏁 What This Repo Is

A day-by-day tracking of my work through CodeWithHarry's 100 Days of Code — Python series. It includes code files, written notes, and exercise solutions serving as a log of my journey from learning to building.

## 🎯 Learning Milestones

### 1. Basics
**Days 1–15**
- Intro to Python, `print`, comments, basic syntax
- Variables, data types (string, int, float, bool)
- **Control flow**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, shorthand conditionals
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `match-case`
- **Exercises**: mini-calculator, “Good Morning Sir” challenges

### 2. Data Structures & Flow Control
**Days 16–35**
- **Strings**: slicing, formatting (`f-strings`), methods
- **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Sets**, **Dictionaries** – creation, indexing, common methods
- Comprehension, `enumerate`, `is` vs `==`
- **Error handling**: `try/except`, `else`, `finally`, custom errors

### 3. Functions & File Handling
**Days 36–55**
- Function definitions, arguments, `return`, docstrings
- Lambdas, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- File I/O: `open`, read/write, `seek()`, `tell()`
- Caching techniques

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming
**Days 56–75**
- Classes, objects, constructors
- Encapsulation: getters, setters, access specifiers, static & class methods
- Inheritance types: single, multiple, multilevel, hybrid
- Dunder methods, method overriding, operator overloading

### 5. Modules & Utilities
**Days 76–90**
- Python standard modules: `os`, `time`, `shutil`, `requests`
- Virtual environments, command‑line utilities, walrus operator (`:=`)
- Generators, decorators, caching, `requests` module usage

### 6. Projects & Advanced Concepts
**Days 91–100**
- Generators, `asyncio`, multithreading, multiprocessing
- Regex, desktop notifications, APIs, scraping
- Final projects: News app, desktop notifier, price scraper

## 📝 Future Plans

- Refactor and enhance selected projects
- Add detailed README for each major topic folder
- Transition from scripts to web/API-based Python projects
- Use this code as learning artefacts or portfolio pieces

## 💬 Encouragement for Learners

If you're considering following this path: **go for it!**  
Every mistake, every bug, and every “aha!” moment helps. I especially loved the OOP section—working through inheritance and decorators really strengthened my understanding. Choose your pace, iterate often, and never shy away from revisiting earlier lessons—growth happens with consistency.

Hope this inspires fellow learners!  
Let’s build, fail, learn, and grow—**day by day**.
