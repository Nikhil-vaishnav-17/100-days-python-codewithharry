#Introduction to Tuples
#It cannot be changed after they are created, it can be defined same as list but with round brackets
tup = (1,2,3,4)
print(type(tup), tup)
#tup[1] = 4 : it will show an error

'''
We can use positive & negative indexing in tuples same as lis, string
we can find the length with len() function
we can check for item like:
if 3 in tup:
    print("Yes)

we can use slicing like tup[1:4] just like strings and list
